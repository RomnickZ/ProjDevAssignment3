Assignment 3

## Purpose
This project is a demonstration for my Assignment 3 in Project Development.

## How to Build and Run
1. Press Code
2. Open Visual Studio
3. Clone it
4. Then Work on the project (Dont forget to commit, push, & pull).

## Licsence
1. I choose MIT liscence as it allows me to work with people and learn from them on how they can make my project/code better, there's something magical if you give people freedom, you learn a lot of things on them.
